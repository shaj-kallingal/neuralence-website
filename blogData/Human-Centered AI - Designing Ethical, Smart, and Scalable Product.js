        "In today’s fast-moving digital landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept. It’s woven into the tools and experiences we use every day—from personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to customer support chatbots and recommendation engines. However, as AI becomes more powerful and pervasive, designing these systems with a human-centered approach becomes critical.",
        "Over 70% of users trust AI more when transparency is built into the design (Source: PwC Human-Centered AI Study). Human-centered AI focuses on aligning machine intelligence with human values, emotions, needs, and contexts, ensuring AI works meaningfully and ethically for people."

Rather than letting technology dictate user behavior, HCAI ensures AI tools are transparent, explainable, inclusive, and easy to interact with."

      paragraphs: [
        "Without a human-centered focus, AI systems can produce harmful outcomes—unintentionally discriminating, spreading misinformation, or making decisions that negatively affect people. A classic example is facial recognition software performing poorly for non-white users due to biased training data.",
        "By embedding ethics and empathy into the AI design process, we can reduce algorithmic bias, improve user trust and adoption, and deliver more personalized, useful experiences. Context-aware AI features reduce user task time by up to 35%, improving efficiency without alienating users."
